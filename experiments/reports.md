Experiment 1.

Investigation:

Find how the number of iterations influence test loss for reward network. 

Motivation: 

To compare different reward netwrok parameters, losses on each set up must converge to eliminate effect of number of iterations on each model set up

The above figure compares 2 runs with the same hyperparameters, but with different number of iteration steps.
